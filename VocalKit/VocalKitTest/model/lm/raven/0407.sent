<s> ONCE UPON A MIDNIGHT DREARY, WHILE I PONDERED, WEAK AND WEARY, </s>
<s> OVER MANY A QUAINT AND CURIOUS VOLUME OF FORGOTTEN LORE-- </s>
<s> WHILE I NODDED, NEARLY NAPPING, SUDDENLY THERE CAME A TAPPING, </s>
<s> AS OF SOME ONE GENTLY RAPPING, RAPPING AT MY CHAMBER DOOR. </s>
<s> "'TIS SOME VISITER," I MUTTERED, "TAPPING AT MY CHAMBER DOOR-- </s>
<s> ONLY THIS AND NOTHING MORE." </s>
